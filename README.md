# Welcome to CoSure (`cosure-dev`)

This is the official GitHub organisation for the CoSure project, a modern, open-source Policy Administration System (PAS) built for insurance brokers, MGAs, and InsurTech startups.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to provide a powerful, flexible, and affordable alternative to proprietary insurance software. We are addressing the key pain points of vendor lock-in, high licensing costs, and lack of control by building a system that is open, extensible, and community-driven.

The CoSure PAS is architected on modern, cloud-native principles to ensure scalability and maintainability.

- **Architecture**: Microservices, API-First, Cloud-Native, Headless (MACH) 
- **Core Technologies**: Go (Golang), Python (FastAPI), Next.js (React), Docker, and Kubernetes
- **Website**: [cosure.co.uk](https://cosure.co.uk)

## Our Vision

We believe that the "no-code/low-code" capability is the future of insurance product creation. Our core architectural goal is to empower users to build and launch insurance products with speed and agility by decoupling the core engines for forms, underwriting, and rating.

## Get Involved

We are at the beginning of our journey and welcome contributors of all kinds. Please explore our repositories and check out our public roadmap to see where you can help.
